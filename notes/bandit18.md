# 18 -> 19

*The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.*

*Command Hints*
`ssh, ls, cat`

[09:36]: If the .bashrc is manipulated, it probably means that it is auto disconnecting me the moment I get on the server. Hence, I need to ssh and make a caat command to print out the password on the readme. \
[09:36]: If you `ssh <and all that jazz> <command here>` the command gets processed. \

# Notes 2$\rightarrow$3

**Hint:**There is nothing on this page                  
[10:31]: There is a `::after` object and a `::before` object. In addition there seems to be an image of 1x1 pixel embedded in the page.                 
[10:32]: I am not quite sure what this is, but lets try to understand what the `::after` and `::before` are.                                        
[10:53]:
    - `::after` and `::before` seem to be selectors that can be designed in the css which they seem to be doing to make these transparent boxes that are translated and rotated. Don't quite understand the point of it.
    - I tried to read the pixel again, but the pixel seems to be something that is a bit strange. I don't seem to be able to cat it and read the password from there like last time. 
    - You can check the files of the webbrowser and there seems to be an interesting file...
